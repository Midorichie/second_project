# Drug Interaction Prediction Tool

## Overview
The Drug Interaction Prediction Tool is a machine learning-based system designed to predict potential interactions between multiple medications. This tool aims to assist healthcare professionals in identifying possible drug interactions, thereby improving patient safety and treatment efficacy.

## Features
- Predicts potential interactions between two drugs
- Uses machine learning (Random Forest Classifier) for predictions
- Handles categorical data preprocessing
- Provides model accuracy and classification report

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Midorichie/drug-interaction-predictor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd drug-interaction-predictor
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your drug interaction data in a CSV format with columns: 'drug1', 'drug2', and 'interaction'.
2. Update the data loading section in the main script to use your data file.
3. Run the main script:
   ```
   python drug_interaction_predictor.py
   ```

## Example
```python
predictor = DrugInteractionPredictor()
predictor.train(X_processed, y)
result = predictor.predict_interaction('DrugA', 'DrugD')
print(f"Predicted interaction between DrugA and DrugD: {result}")
```

## Project Structure
- `drug_interaction_predictor.py`: Main script containing the DrugInteractionPredictor class
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies
- `data/`: Directory to store your drug interaction dataset (not included in the repository)

## Future Improvements
- Implement more advanced feature engineering
- Explore other machine learning models
- Add functionality for multi-drug interactions
- Implement a more sophisticated data loading and preprocessing pipeline
- Add cross-validation for model evaluation
- Implement error handling and input validation
